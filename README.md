Wordle is a web-based word game designed and developed by Josh Wardle, a Welsh software engineer, and owned and published by The New York Times Company since 2022. In this game, players get six chances to identify a five-letter word, with feedback provided in the form of colored tiles indicating whether letters match or occupy the proper location for each guess. The game I created was inspired by the main Wordle game. However, my game can only be played through the command line. If you have Python installed on a computer, you can start playing the game just by downloading the folder.

Open the file named ```wordle_game_with_python.py``` and start playing!.
